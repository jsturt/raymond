Path-tracing experiment based off of a university project

Setup to be built with [`Meson`](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson). 

Example scene file provided in the `scenefile` dir, copy it next to the executable to run or write your own.

Long term goals include but are not limitted to:
- CUDA Parallelisation
- CLI based arguments
- Proper colour space management
- Full PBR treatment
- Comparison of different sampling approaches
- Spatial partitioning
- Traingle meshes 
- Spectral rendering

This is project has been and is a test-bed for learning both C++ and path tracing, it should not be seen as any authority on how a path tracer should or could be written.
